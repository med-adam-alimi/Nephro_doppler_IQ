# Nephro_doppler_IQ: AI-Enhanced Medical Data Management

## üìå Overview
Nephro_doppler_IQ is a healthcare application developed during my internship with **REGIM Lab (ENIS, Tunisia)** in collaboration with **Hedi Chaker Hospital (Sfax)**.  
The system enables **digitization of patient records** (photos/videos) and integrates an **AI model to classify Doppler ultrasound images**, assisting nephrologists in faster decision-making.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Digitization**: Seamless storage of patient photos/videos directly into Google Drive.  
- **AI Evaluation**: Quality check of medical inputs using an AI classification model.  
- **Medical Classification**: CNN-based model trained on Doppler images to reduce diagnostic time by ~40%.  
- **Cross-Platform**: Available as both **mobile and web apps** (Flutter + Firebase).  

---

## üß† AI Model
- **Architecture**: CNN-based classifier with medical data preprocessing.  
- **Dataset**: Anonymized Doppler ultrasound images collected in hospital collaboration.  
- **Impact**: Reduced manual diagnostic time, improved diagnostic workflow efficiency.
